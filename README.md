# Congressional Apportionment

Simulate how Congress apportions seats in the House, and try your own method!

## The data

There are two files in the [data](data) directory, `apportionment_2010.csv` and `apportionment_2020.csv`. These files were directly downloaded from the Census and lightly modified for readability. They contain both the official decennial population counts used for apportionment and the resulting number of seats, such that the user can check her calculations against the official results.
